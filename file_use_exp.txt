Description of what the information will be used for:

The search query done in the code to obtain the information in the output files from BLAST and Kegg was "drosophila melanogaster" or "dme" (for Kegg), representing a search for the genes relating to this species in these databases. This search was not limited to a gene or chromosome, so there is all of the possible sequences and gene information for the known data for the drosophila melanogaster organism in these files. This is useful because I am doing a comparison across different species of Drosophila, and therefore cannot restrict my search to one certain gene. Having all of the possible DNA and protein sequences will allow me to compare the differences across these sequences in my project (the script) and determine what these differences mean in terms of the methods and outcomes of sex differentiation across a variety of Drosophila species. This can be done for a variety of species by just changing the search term to a different species, therefore allowing me to have access to all the information for each species.
